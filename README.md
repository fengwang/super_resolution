# Super Resolution

![](https://github.com/fengwang/super_resolution/raw/master/assets/demo_2.png)


Image Super-Resolution using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Installing

Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```bash
pip3 install super-resolution
```
Or
```bash
git checkout https://github.com/fengwang/super_resolution.git
cd super_resolution
python3 -m pip install -e .
```


## Usage

Command line:

```bash
super_resolution INPUT_IMAGE_PATH OUTPUT_IMAGE_PATH_4X
```

Using Python API:

```python
# uncomment the follow three lines if you have a Nvidia GPU but you do not want to enable it.
#import os
#os.environ["CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER"] = "PCI_BUS_ID"
#os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]=''

from super_resolution import cartoon_upsampling_4x
large_image = cartoon_upsampling_4x( './a_tiny_input_image.png', './a_4x_larger_output_image.png' )

from super_resolution import cartoon_upsampling_8x
large_image = cartoon_upsampling_8x( './a_tiny_input_image.png', './a_8x_larger_output_image.png' )
```

## Details

+ The super resolution model is inherited from `Ledig C, Theis L, Husz√°r F, et al. Photo-realistic single image super-resolution using a generative adversarial network, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2017: 4681-4690.`
+ The training images are downloaded from [Konachan (__NSFW__)](https://konachan.com/).
+ This package will download pretrained models from github, storing it it path `~/.deepoffice/super_resolution/model`. If not working properly, please remove this folder and try again.
